          <h3>Hello, I’m Puja</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>
              I'm a B.Tech Computer Science student at Galgotias University
            </strong>{" "}
            with a deep love for solving real-world problems through{" "}
            <span className="highlight">Data Structures & Algorithms</span> —
            especially using <span className="highlight">Java</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I began exploring coding out of curiosity, and quickly discovered a
            passion for solving real-world challenges using logic and structure.
            I realized I enjoy{" "}
            <span className="highlight">logical problem-solving</span> just as
            much as building beautiful, responsive UIs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, I started <strong>creating frontend projects</strong>{" "}
            using{" "}
            <span className="highlight">HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React</span>. I
            love making interfaces that not only look good, but feel intuitive.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>When I’m not coding,</strong> you’ll find me exploring new places 
            and learning about different cultures—it keeps me curious and open-minded.
            Besides that, I often spend time learning new skills online to improve myself.
          </p>

          <p className="available">
            I'm currently open to internships and full-time job opportunities
            related to frontend development and DSA mentoring!
          </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Strength:</strong> Quick learner with a strong ability
                to adapt to new technologies quickly and effectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Weakness:</strong> Sometimes impatient when solutions
                don’t come immediately, but I channel this energy into working
                harder until I solve the problem.
